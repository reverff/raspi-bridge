HAP-Java-Sample
=========
A sample implementation of a simple accessory using [HAP-Java](https://github.com/beowulfe/HAP-Java).

This is for demonstration purposes only and lacks any kind of persistence. An actual implementation will need to persist the accessory
authentication information between app launches to maintain pairing information with the iOS devices.
